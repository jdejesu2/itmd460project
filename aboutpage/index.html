          <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                VAMOS was founded in 2001 as S.O.L., Summer of Learning, a student-led
                organization, by Claudette Soto (at the time an undergrad Illinois
                Institute of Technology) in response to the lack of opportunities
                for the youth of Gage Park to enter and be exposed to STEAM fields.
                S.O.L. was also started to commemorate the life of Juan Manuel Flores,
                a gifted young man who grew up in Back of the Yards and attended Curie
                High School.
          </p>

          <p>
                Juan was labeled a lost cause because he was frequently truant from
                school, dabbled with drugs and alcohol, and other countless biases.
                While these aspects are true, no one knew that when Juan would
                skip school he would go to the library and sit there for hours
                reading. He taught himself poetry, calculus, physics, arts,
                anything and everything he could get his hands on.
          </p>

          <p>
                In the Fall of 1996, Juan decided to walk along the “L” tracks.
                He slipped and fell hitting the electrified rail. There ended all
                of his potential at the age of 19. Education and peer involvement
                were needed, but not given to Juan, an issue that occurs everyday
                in countless neighborhoods across Chicago. During the winter of 2002,
                S.O.L was changed to VAMOS (Volunteer and Mentor One Summer
                “In Memory of Juan”) and the component of mentorship was added.
                A higher level of peer involvement took place, as well as more
                parental involvement. VAMOS was comprised of professionals seeking
                to promote higher education to those who might otherwise be labeled
                as “lost causes”; to provide direction in short-term educational
                improvement and long-term college attendance. VAMOS was the next
                step to reaching and supporting a community who would have otherwise
                gone unnoticed.
          </p>

          <p>
                In the summer of 2016, VAMOS was relaunched, and along with the
                same principles, a new generation of students, under the guidance
                of Claudette, will reach out and touch the lives of the students
                in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, Gage Park and Brighton Park.
                Our goal is to connect with students who are not the high achievers
                and help them reach their full potential in not only STEAM related
                fields and higher education, but by also embracing their Latino culture.
